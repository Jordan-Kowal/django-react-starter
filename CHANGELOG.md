## [v4.0.0] - 2025-03-28

✨ **Major frontend rework** ✨

In an attempt to have a simpler, faster, and lighter frontend,
I made the following (very opinionated) changes:

- 🎨 **Design rework**: we moved away from `antd` and instead chose the CSS-only `daisyUI` package
- 🗣️ **i18n support**: The starter is fully setup for i18n and already handles both French and English
- 📦 **Smaller**: The bundle size has been reduced by more than half, and now sits at ~150kB gzip
- 🔗 **Deps**: We removed and clean up deps, and replaced some of them with smaller/simpler alternatives

See the full list of changes below
